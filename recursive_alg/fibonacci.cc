/*
Sometimes when you are a Computer Science student, youâ€™ll see an exercise or a problem involving the Fibonacci sequence.
This sequence has the first two values 0 (zero) and 1 (one) and each next value will always be the sum of the two preceding numbers.
By definition, the formula to find any Fibonacci number is:
fib(0) = 0
fib(1) = 1
fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);

One way of finding Fibonacci numbers is by recursive calls.
This is illustrated below, presenting the tree of derivation when we calculate fib(4), i.e. the fifth value of this sequence:

      int k = fibonacci(a[i]);
      std::cout << "fib("<< a[i] <<") = "<< cont-1 ;
      std::cout << " calls = " << k << std::endl;
      cont = 0;
  }
